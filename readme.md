A simple application that takes in a starting address and a destination address and reports back how long it will take to drive each way.



Technologies used are HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery.

Feedback welcome!

Feedback so far:

Session 1

* Bold the result "time" so it stands out. [Done!]

* Automatically capitalize and standardize the text input

* Make the "submit" button smaller? [Done!]

* Clear results for each new inquiry? (prevent repeating of results)

* Add preview image of the route.

* Add link to google maps query for each place.

Session 2

* Add an error alert if what you entered is an invalid address

* Add a user query if an addrress has multiple matches

* Add a reset option to clear previous queries

Session 3

* Better explanation as to what to do // I'm not sure what to do with this

Session 4

* instead of address say street address

* entered in two addresses and it gave me the wrong time - perhaps offer some options if there are multiple results

* add option to select walking instead of driving
