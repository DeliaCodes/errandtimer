A way to time how long it would take you to run an errand and get back home. Feedback welcome!

Feedback so far:

* Bold the result "time" so it stands put

* Automatically capitalize and standardize the text input

* Make the "submit" button smaller?

* Clear results for each new inquiry? (prevent repeating of results)
